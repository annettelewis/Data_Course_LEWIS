1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.Based on the values that I have obtained by looking into the performance of mod2 where we can see that the AIC and AICc values are low, allowing the data to fit to avoid overfitting. The R2 value was 0.617, which is moderately high. In mod2, I was looking at the situational variance between species, humidity, and light as a function of the growth rate. In this case, these all played an important role in the growth rate of these mushroom species.2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? 
In my plots, I didn't find any nonlinear relationships. That could be that I wasn't looking into the right things to encounter that kind of relationship.

3. Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.Link to resource: https://data-flair.training/blogs/r-nonlinear-regression/4. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)dmv <- read_csv("../../Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")dmv %>% ggplot(aes(x=predictor, y=response)) +  geom_point()# linear modelnewmodel <- lm(response ~ predictor, data = dmv)summary(newmodel)
